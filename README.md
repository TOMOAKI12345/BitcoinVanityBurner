## Custom vanity address generator 
You can make vanity address just for burning. (without privatekey)
When you type "bitcoinvanityburner" then "1bitcoinvenityburnerXXXXXXXT1jCa8" address created.
We can assume no one has the private key of the "1bitcoinvenityburnerXXXXXXXT1jCa8" address. So this is custom vanity adderess to burn.

## To run
$ npm install 
$ sudo mongod
$ grunt serve

You can think this tool as enabling you to write 34 chars directly on blockchain with 0.00001097 = less than $ 0.005 dollar fee (transaction fee average 03/25/2015).

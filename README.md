## Custom vanity burning address generator 
You can make vanity address just for burning. (you, anyone will never know the private key)
When you type "bitcoinvanityburner" then "1bitcoinvenityburnerXXXXXXXT1jCa8" address will be created.
We can assume no one has the private key of the "1bitcoinvenityburnerXXXXXXXT1jCa8" address.
If you want to create vanity address, it has private key, please use [bitcoin vanity gen](https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen)
